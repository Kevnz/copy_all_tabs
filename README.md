#Copy All Tabs

Copy All Tabs is a Firefox Add-on that takes the address and title for each tab and creates a text list of links. The list is copied to your clipboard so you can paste it to your notes. You can also open tabs from a previously saved list of links.

This Add-on is available for Firefox here:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/copy-all-tabs/?src=api

This Add-on is functionally similar to CopyAllUrls (http://www.plasser.net/copyallurls/). I have used that add-on for many years with Firefox (Thank you, JÃ¼rgen!). The author has indicated that it is no longer being maintained. Now that Firefox requires Add-ons to be signed, the original is being blocked by Firefox.

This is a simple Add-on. It uses Firefox's Add-ons SDK:

Functionality is available via the context menu. Right-click on a page to find "Copy Tabs" and "Paste Tabs".
